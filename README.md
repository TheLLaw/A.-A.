Simple script to remove all the rare armors and weapons from postmaster so you don't lose the good stuff.

Created by Law#0668 (on discord) any issues dm me I will be glad to help you.

Basically what it does is when your postmaster gets to 20 hashes or more it will transfer all the hashes with the type `rare` to the vault.

Don't use the bungie api. It's complete trash.

Idk what to put here lmfao.

Oh yeah the tutorial of how to use this.

FOLLOW ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS STRICTLY.

1. Download and install python (because best programming language) and make sure to add to path (it's one of the options during the instalation). https://www.python.org/
2. Download the code. (Keep in mind windows defender will flag this as a virus. IT IS NOT TRUE THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT MALWARE BUT WIN DEFENDER INDENTIFIES ALL pyinstaller FILES AS MALWARE: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/e99bhe/why_does_pyinstaller_trigger_windows_defender/) I don't recommend you totally disable your anti-virus but you can go to settings and add an exception and select this folder.
3. Open the command prompt and navigate (using cd foldername) to the directory of this program in your computer. If python was correctly installed if you type `pip install -r requirements.txt` you will see that it successfully installs all dependencies.
4. Go to https://www.bungie.net/en/Application REMINDER YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE LOGGED IN TO BUNGIE.NET IN YOUR BROWSER FOR THIS WHOLE PROGRAM TO WORK!
5. Register an application and name it whatever you want. On app authentication the client type must be confidential and in redirect url put https://giphy.com/gifs/throwback-rick-roll-astley-5kq0GCjHA8Rwc. In scopes enable all of them.
6. Run the setup file and when it asks for an api key give the one shown on the website.
7. Run the not so sketchy exe file that is not a virus and for secret reasons I can't show it's source code. rEmEmBeR gUyS iTs NoT a ViRuS!1!1!!
8. Follow the instructions and relax knowing that you won't lose whatever the name of the items is.

Man I should start playing destiny 2 right.


Any issues: Run it again. You should have multiple files in ur directory. It might crash once or twice just keep booting it up. I'm lazy and don't wanna fix that, don't wanna compile it. Also it doesn't affect performance that much I didn't see one frame drop during my gameplay sooo ig cool.

Btw for anyone asking why this is encrypted. Basically I had no idea of how to encrypt my api key. Yen Yang of python. Soo I made you create your own bungie application and did some basic encrypting. If you really want to see the code just decrypt it ok. Just don't make fun of my trash code lol (it says in bungie terms of use that you are not allowed to share your api key in any capacity and I don't wanna be banned from my beloved game that I haven't played in a few weeks).

:D
